### RH Utensils Radio
I've started developing this add-on for the  RH Utensils main program. With the function to playing local and online music _(e.g. from YouTube or other providers)_ and playing various radios from around the world with a beautiful user interface. As I decided to cancel the RH Utensils Main program, I started with a WebApp alternative which can be found on [github.com/rh-utensils/MusicPlayer](https://github.com/rh-utensils/MusicPlayer)

### RH Utensils Main
That should turn into a Windows desktop program which simplify account management, update delivery and menu display, via an Add-On System. It was pretty much near the release, but I canceled the development because I decided to mainly develop web apps, because they can be used universally on all devices and require less development effort.
